📚 Book Tracker
Welcome to your second interview at Titan!

In this challenge, you'll work with a small fullstack Book Tracker app using React on the frontend and Node.js (Express) on the backend.

Your mission is to fix known issues, implement new features, and connect the frontend with the backend.

🧪 Your Tasks
Try to complete as many of the following tasks as possible within the allotted time (about 60 minutes). Prioritize clean, readable code and working functionality over perfection.

🔧 Step 1: Fix Known Issues (Frontend)
Selected books are lost when filtered out and then cleared
Selecting a book (e.g., "1984") and then filtering ("84") causes the wrong book to be highlighted

Step 2: Backend Work (Node.js)
Update the /books endpoint to support server-side filtering.

Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend
Update the frontend so that book filtering is handled by the backend (/books?filter=<query>) instead of locally.
If filter is provided, return matching books (case-insensitive)
If no filter is passed, return the full list

Step 4: Add Features (Frontend)
Submit Button with Cancelable Countdown
Add a submit button below the list:
When clicked, start a 10-second countdown
Update button label: Cancel (X seconds)
Allow canceling the submission by clicking again
After 10 seconds, disable the button and show “Done”
On completion, send a POST request to the backend (/submit) with the selected books



🕐 Time Limit
Estimated time: ~60 minutes

Do your best — partial solutions are totally okay!
